# C# solutions to Project Euler problems #

This repo contains C# code for solutions to the challenges set on the Project Euler website (see https://projecteuler.net/archives).

<br>

The ProjectEuler solution consists of the following projects:

- **ProjectEulerCS**: A console application implementing C# solutions to several Project Euler challenges.
- **ProjectEulerCS.Tests**: A set of tests that execute the challenges, asserting that the correct results are generated.

<br>

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 6](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
  
  The ProjectEuler.sln file is a Visual Studio 2022 solution.

<br>

### Why was this created?

For fun... why else? :-)  
  
<br>

### Usage

The **ProjectEulerCS** console application runs each problem, writing the calculated results to the console window.

Alternatively, load the solution into Visual Studio 2022 and run the tests.
